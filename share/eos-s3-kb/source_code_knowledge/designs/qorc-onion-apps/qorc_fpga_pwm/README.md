# ONION FPGA PWM Module Example

## Intro

We create a simple pwm module, and instantiate 3 blocks from it, to control the RGB LEDs of the QuickFeather.

Once flashed and board is reset, we can see the RGB LED glow in magenta (RED+BLUE) with 3 steps of brightness, followed by yellow(RED+GREEN) with 3 steps of brightness, each step lasting for approximately 4 seconds.

## How To

### Command Line Usage

`note: all the commands below are run from the root of this directory.`

#### Initialize Environment

Before clean/build/load/flash, ensure that the bash environment is setup by doing the below:

1.  Ensure that QORC-SDK is initialized and ready:

    ``` bash
    source ../../envsetup.sh
    ```

    ``` none
    note: assumes this repo 'qorc-onion-apps' is cloned into the QORC SDK dir, at the same level as qf_apps
    ```

    In general, use:

    ``` none
    source <QORC_SDK_PATH>/envsetup.sh
    ```

2.  \[Only\] If you are using the RP2040/Pico as a debugger (picoprobe), then ensure that the RaspberryPi flavor of OpenOCD is initialized and ready:

    ``` bash
    source .scaffolding/onion_openocd_picoprobe_setup.sh
    ```

3.  If you want to use the SVD file for EOS-S3 to watch registers while debugging, then ensure that the SVD file is initialized and ready:

    ``` bash
    source .scaffolding/onion_svd_setup.sh
    ```

    ``` none
    note: the SVD file is in very early alpha and missing many registers, use with discretion!
    ```

    To force download of latest SVD file from repo and replace the existing one, use:

    ``` bash
    source .scaffolding/onion_svd_setup.sh force
    ```

#### Clean/Build/Load/Flash (Command Line)

- Clean using:

  fpga: `make clean` -or- `make clean-fpga`

- Build using:

  fpga: `make` -or- `make fpga`

- Load and run the design on the board using JLinkExe, using:

  (assumes the board has been booted in DEBUG mode)

  ``` bash
  make load-jlink
  ```

- Load and run the design on the board using OpenOCD, using:

  (assumes the board has been booted in DEBUG mode)

  ``` bash
  export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=/path/to/inteface/cfg    # needs to be done only once in the current shell
  make load-openocd
  ```

  The interface cfg file depends on the debug adapter chosen.

  Here are a few common adapters that can be used with the EOS_S3:

  1.  JLink Adapters: `export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=.scaffolding/jlink_swd.cfg` (available in the current dir)
  2.  FT2232H Boards: `export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=.scaffolding/ft2232h_swd.cfg` (available in the current dir)
  3.  STLinkv2 Adapters: `export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=interface/stlink-v2.cfg` (available in the OpenOCD install scripts dir)
  4.  DAPLink Adapters: `export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=interface/cmsis-dap.cfg` (available in the OpenOCD install scripts dir)
  5.  picoprobe: `export QORC_OCD_IF_CFG=interface/picoprobe.cfg` (available in the OpenOCD install scripts dir, only if RaspberryPi flavor OpenOCD has been initialized)

  Practically, any adapter that supports OpenOCD and SWD can be used with the appropriate cfg file passed in.

- Flash and run the design on the board using qfprog:

  (assumes the board is put into `programming` mode)

  ``` bash
  export QORC_PORT=/path/to/serial/port   # needs to be done only once in current shell
  make flash
  ```

  Set the serial port as applicable, this is generally `export QORC_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0`

### VS Code Usage

#### Dependencies

- VS Code Extension: `ms-vscode.cpptools`  
  link: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools>  
  why: C/C++ Intellisense, Debugging  

- VS Code Extension: `marus25.cortex-debug`  
  link: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug>  
  why: Cortex-M Debug Launch Configuration  

- VS Code Extension: `augustocdias.tasks-shell-input`  
  link: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=augustocdias.tasks-shell-input>  
  why: Scan serial-ports for `flash` task, Select FPGA '.openocd' file for `Debug (OpenOCD)` debug launch config  

#### Initialize Project Configuration

The first time the project is going to be used from VS Code, we need to do the following:

1.  copy `.vscode/settings.template.jsonc` as `.vscode/settings.json`

    Ensure the following variables are correctly defined:

    ``` none
    "qorc_sdk_path" : "${workspaceFolder}/../..",
    ```

    In VS Code:

    `${env:HOME}` refers to \$HOME of the current user

    `${workspaceFolder}` refers to the current directory

    Remaining variables don't need to be changed.

2.  Open the current directory in VS Code using `File > Open Folder` menu

    - To be able to run the 'flash' task or 'Debug (OpenOCD)' launch config, remember to install the extension: `augustocdias.tasks-shell-input`
    - To be able to 'debug' the code with gdb, remember to install the extension: `marus25.cortex-debug`

    On opening the folder, VS Code should prompt to install these "recommended extensions", if not already installed, select `Install All` to automatically install them.

#### Clean/Build/Load/Flash (VS Code)

Any "task" can be run in VS Code using the `Terminal > Run Task` menu, which shows a drop down list of tasks

-OR-

Using keyboard shortcuts: `ctrl+p` and then type `task<space>`, which shows a drop down list of tasks

- Clean using:

  - fpga: run the `clean-fpga` task

- Build using:

  - fpga: run the `build-fpga` task

- Load and run the design on the board using JLinkExe, using:

  (assumes the board has been booted in DEBUG mode)

  run the `load (JLink)` task

- Load and run the design on the board using OpenOCD, using:

  (assumes the board has been booted in DEBUG mode)

  run the `load (OpenOCD)` task

  This will show a drop down menu with the options of debug adapters currently tested:

  - JLink Adapters `.scaffolding/jlink_swd.cfg`
  - FT2232H Boards `.scaffolding/ft2232h_swd.cfg`
  - STLinkv2 Adapters `interface/stlink-v2.cfg`
  - DAPLink Adapters `interface/cmsis-dap.cfg`

  select the appropriate one.

- Load and run the design on the board using OpenOCD and picoprobe, using:

  (assumes the board has been booted in DEBUG mode)

  run the `load (OpenOCD-picoprobe)` task

- Flash and run the design on the board using qfprog:

  (assumes the board is put into `programming` mode)

  run the `flash` task

  This will show a 'pickstring' drop down menu with the available serial ports in the system, select the appropriate one.

  (This is usually `/dev/ttyACM0`)

- `x-get-ports` : this is an **internal** task, which is used by the `flash` task to obtain a list of available serial ports on the system to use for flashing. This list is displayed to the user as a 'pickstring' dropdown menu, as described in the `flash` task above.
